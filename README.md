## Default keybindings ##

All available keybindings are defined in `keymap.json`. 

To redefine them, simply update `keymap.json` action values with new keybindings (see [CodeMirror Manual](http://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#keymaps) for key reference).

## [Extensions support](http://docs.emmet.io/customization/)

Emmet for Brackets supports extensions: you should open `Emmet > Preferences…` dialog and enter absolute path to extentions folder. Unfortunately, Brackets doesn’t support folder picking dialog so you have to type it manually.
